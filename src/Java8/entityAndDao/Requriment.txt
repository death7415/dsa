Certainly, here are some challenging scenario-based questions focusing on Java 8 Streams:

1. **Employee Data Analysis**:
   - Given a list of `Employee` objects, each with properties like `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`, and `dateOfJoining`, perform the following tasks using Java 8 Streams:
     - Calculate the average salary of employees in each department.
     - Identify the employee with the longest tenure in the company.
     - List the names of employees who joined after a specific date, sorted by their joining date.
     - Group employees by their department and then by their joining year.

2. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Given a list of `Transaction` objects, each containing `transactionId`, `userId`, `amount`, `timestamp`, and `status`, accomplish the following using Streams:
     - Compute the total transaction amount for each user.
     - Find the top 2 users who have the highest total transaction amounts.
     - Filter out transactions that are either `FAILED` or `PENDING` and then sort the successful transactions by amount in descending order.
     - Determine if all transactions within a specific time frame are successful.

3. **Product Inventory Management**:
   - Given a list of `Product` objects with attributes like `productId`, `name`, `category`, `price`, and `stockQuantity`, perform the following tasks:
     - Generate a list of products that are out of stock.
     - Calculate the total value of products available in each category.
     - Identify the most expensive product in each category.
     - Create a map where the key is the category, and the value is a list of product names sorted by price.

4. **Student Performance Evaluation**:
   - Given a list of `Student` objects, each with properties `studentId`, `name`, `gradeLevel`, and a list of `scores` in various subjects, achieve the following using Streams:
     - Calculate the average score of each student across all subjects.
     - Determine the top-performing student in each grade level based on average score.
     - List the names of students who have scored below a certain threshold in any subject.
     - Group students by their grade level and then partition them into pass and fail groups based on a passing score criteria.

5. **Order Fulfillment System**:
   - Given a list of `Order` objects, each containing `orderId`, `customerId`, `orderDate`, `deliveryDate`, `items` (a list of `Item` objects), and `status`, perform the following:
     - Calculate the total number of orders placed by each customer.
     - Find the average delivery time for delivered orders.
     - List all items that have been ordered more than a specified number of times.
     - Generate a report of orders that are overdue for delivery, sorted by the number of days they are overdue.

==================================================================

**Comprehensive Data Processing Challenge**:

You are provided with a list of `Order` objects, each containing the following attributes:

- `orderId` (String): Unique identifier for the order.
- `customerId` (String): Identifier for the customer who placed the order.
- `orderDate` (LocalDate): Date when the order was placed.
- `deliveryDate` (Optional<LocalDate>): Date when the order was delivered; empty if not yet delivered.
- `items` (List<Item>): List of items included in the order.
- `status` (OrderStatus): Current status of the order (e.g., `PENDING`, `SHIPPED`, `DELIVERED`, `CANCELLED`).

Each `Item` object includes:

- `productId` (String): Unique identifier for the product.
- `productName` (String): Name of the product.
- `category` (String): Category to which the product belongs.
- `quantity` (int): Number of units ordered.
- `price` (double): Price per unit.

**Tasks**:

1. **Total Sales per Category**:
   - Calculate the total sales amount for each product category across all orders.

2. **Top Customers by Spending**:
   - Identify the top 5 customers who have spent the most, considering only `DELIVERED` orders.

3. **Pending Orders Analysis**:
   - List all `PENDING` orders that have been pending for more than 7 days from the `orderDate`.

4. **Product Performance**:
   - Determine the top 3 best-selling products based on the total quantity sold.

5. **Customer Order History**:
   - For each customer, generate a list of their orders, sorted by `orderDate` in descending order.

6. **Monthly Sales Report**:
   - Generate a report showing the total sales amount for each month in the current year.

7. **Undelivered Orders Summary**:
   - Provide a summary of orders that have not been delivered (`status` is not `DELIVERED`), including the count of such orders and the total value.

8. **Category-wise Product List**:
   - Create a map where each key is a product category, and the corresponding value is a list of product names in that category, sorted alphabetically.

9. **High-Value Orders**:
   - Identify orders where the total order value exceeds a specified threshold.

10. **Customer Spending Partition**:
    - Partition customers into two groups: those who have spent more than a specified amount and those who have spent less or equal to that amount.

**Constraints**:

- Utilize Java 8 Stream API features such as filtering, mapping, reducing, collecting, grouping, and partitioning to accomplish the tasks.
- Ensure that operations are efficient and make use of parallel streams where appropriate.
- Handle optional values gracefully, especially for fields like `deliveryDate`.
- Consider edge cases, such as orders with no items or customers with no orders.

This comprehensive challenge is designed to test your ability to apply various Stream operations in Java 8 to perform complex data processing tasks efficiently.
