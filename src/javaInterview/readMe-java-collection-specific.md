## Best Java Collections for Common Scenarios

---
1. Scenario: Frequent Insertion and Deletion
   Best Java Collection: LinkedList
   Explanation:

6. Scenario: Maintain Insertion Order of Keys
   Best Java Collection: LinkedHashMap
   Explanation:

* Extends HashMap and maintains insertion order using a doubly-linked list.

7. Scenario: Maintain Unique Elements
   Best Java Collection: HashSet
   Explanation:

* Backed by a HashMap.
* O(1) add, remove, contains for unique items.
* Used for ensuring uniqueness, filtering duplicates.

8. Scenario: Sorted Set without Duplicates
   Best Java Collection: TreeSet
   Explanation:

* Implements NavigableSet, backed by TreeMap.
* Maintains sorted order of elements.
* Great for ordered set of data without duplicates.

9. Scenario: Maintain Insertion Order in Set
   Best Java Collection: LinkedHashSet
   Explanation:

* HashSet with insertion order preserved.
* Ideal when you want uniqueness with predictable iteration.
* Useful for ordered filters or logs.

10. Scenario: LIFO Stack Behavior
    Best Java Collection: ArrayDeque
    Explanation:

* More efficient than Stack (legacy class).
* Implements Deque, supports push/pop/peek at O(1).
* Recommended for LIFO operations.

11. Scenario: FIFO Queue Behavior
    Best Java Collection: ArrayDeque or LinkedList
    Explanation:

* Queue interface implemented by both.
* ArrayDeque preferred for performance.
* Suited for job queues, messaging.

12. Scenario: Priority Based Processing
    Best Java Collection: PriorityQueue
    Explanation:

* Implements Queue and uses a heap internally.
* Provides O(log n) insertion and removal.
* Great for schedulers, simulation.

13. Scenario: Sorted Map with Custom Comparator
    Best Java Collection: TreeMap with Comparator
    Explanation:

* Pass custom comparator to sort keys as needed.
* Useful when natural ordering is not sufficient.
* Example: sort by string length or reverse order.

14. Scenario: Fast Access with Thread Safety
    Best Java Collection: ConcurrentHashMap
    Explanation:

* Provides concurrent access to key-value pairs.
* Thread-safe without full locking.
* Ideal for web caches, analytics counters.

15. Scenario: Fixed Capacity Queue
    Best Java Collection: ArrayBlockingQueue
    Explanation:

* BlockingQueue implementation with fixed size.
* Thread-safe for producer-consumer use cases.
* Blocks on full/empty operations.

16. Scenario: Delay-Based Scheduling
    Best Java Collection: DelayQueue
    Explanation:

* BlockingQueue that holds elements until delay expires.
* Used for job scheduling, retry mechanisms.
* Requires Delayed interface implementation.

17. Scenario: Time-Based Task Expiry
    Best Java Collection: LinkedHashMap (with accessOrder)
    Explanation:

* Override removeEldestEntry() to enforce TTL.
* Used for implementing LRU caches.
* Combine with System.currentTimeMillis() if needed.

18. Scenario: Unique Items with Concurrent Access
    Best Java Collection: ConcurrentSkipListSet
    Explanation:

* Thread-safe sorted set.
* Backed by ConcurrentSkipListMap.
* Good for high-concurrency scenarios.

19. Scenario: Blocking Stack or Queue
    Best Java Collection: LinkedBlockingDeque
    Explanation:

* Deque + BlockingQueue behavior.
* Blocks on insert/remove if empty/full.
* Perfect for producer-consumer pipelines.

20. Scenario: Frequency Counting
    Best Java Collection: HashMap\<T, Integer>
    Explanation:

* Track frequency using getOrDefault() or merge().
* Can be paired with PriorityQueue for top K elements.
* Common in word count, histogram problems.

21. Scenario: Remove Duplicate From List
    Best Java Collection: LinkedHashSet + List
    Explanation:

* Convert list to LinkedHashSet and back.
* Maintains order and removes duplicates.
* Clean one-liner approach.

22. Scenario: Maintain Key Insertion and Access Order
    Best Java Collection: LinkedHashMap (accessOrder=true)
    Explanation:

* Enables MRU or LRU tracking.
* Update order based on access.
* Common in caching algorithms.

23. Scenario: Implement LFU Cache
    Best Java Collection: HashMap + TreeMap or LinkedHashSet
    Explanation:

* Track frequencies with HashMap.
* Use TreeMap to sort frequencies.
* Efficient LFU eviction policies.

24. Scenario: Auto-Sorting Without TreeMap
    Best Java Collection: PriorityQueue
    Explanation:

* Add all items to queue for auto-sorting on poll.
* Space-efficient over TreeMap for one-time sort.
* Good for top K scenarios.

25. Scenario: Reverse Sorted Set
    Best Java Collection: TreeSet with Collections.reverseOrder()
    Explanation:

* Comparator.reverseOrder() used at construction.
* Maintains descending sorted elements.
* Ideal for leaderboard or reverse ranking.

26. Scenario: Safe Map Iteration During Update
    Best Java Collection: ConcurrentHashMap with forEach()
    Explanation:

* Safe concurrent iteration.
* Uses weakly consistent iterator.
* Perfect for logs, stats collection.

27. Scenario: Thread-Safe Set
    Best Java Collection: ConcurrentSkipListSet or CopyOnWriteArraySet
    Explanation:

* For sorted use SkipListSet.
* For read-heavy loads use CopyOnWrite.
* Used in multithreaded systems.

28. Scenario: Safe Iteration + Modification of List
    Best Java Collection: CopyOnWriteArrayList
    Explanation:

* Snapshot iterator prevents ConcurrentModificationException.
* Good for observer lists.

30. Scenario: Access N-th Smallest Element
    Best Java Collection: TreeSet or PriorityQueue
    Explanation:

* Sorted structures enable index-based logic.
* Combine with iterator for positional access.
* Efficient for partial sorting needs.
